# Bitcoin Time Series Forecasting

Bitcoin, the pioneering and most renowned cryptocurrency, was first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Functioning as a decentralized digital medium of exchange, Bitcoin enables transactions to be verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain. This technology eliminates the need for a trusted record-keeping authority or central intermediary. Each transaction block in the blockchain contains a cryptographic hash of previous blocks, creating an immutable record of all past transactions. As Bitcoin gained public adoption, trading and financial instruments related to Bitcoin emerged and continue to expand in the market.

If you are unfamiliar with Bitcoin, it is recommended to gain basic knowledge about Bitcoin before proceeding with this project. You can find introductory information about Bitcoin here.

This repository consists of a Kernel divided into two main parts:

## Data Exploration: 
This section focuses on exploring and analyzing the Bitcoin time series data. It includes visualizations, statistical analysis, and insights to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## Time Series Analysis: 
In this section, we delve into the techniques and methodologies for time series forecasting using the Bitcoin dataset. We explore various forecasting models and algorithms to predict future trends and patterns in Bitcoin prices.

### The Time Series Forecasting section covers the following techniques:

Time Series forecasting with LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) specifically designed for processing sequential data. We demonstrate how to utilize LSTM for Bitcoin price prediction.

Time Series forecasting with XGBoost: XGBoost is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm widely used for time series forecasting. We explain how to apply XGBoost to the Bitcoin dataset to generate accurate forecasts.

Time Series forecasting with Facebook Prophet: Facebook Prophet is a forecasting library developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team. We showcase how to leverage Prophet for Bitcoin price forecasting.

Time Series forecasting with ARIMA: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a classic time series forecasting model. We illustrate how to implement ARIMA for Bitcoin price prediction.

Please refer to the notebook sections in the ipynb file for detailed explanations, code samples, and visualizations related to each forecasting technique.
